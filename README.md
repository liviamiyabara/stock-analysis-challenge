# stock-analysis
Challenge 2: VBA

## Overview of Project

The analysis was developed to help the user determine the total daily volume and return for a set of stocks in a selected year. Daily volume is the total number of shares traded during a day; it calculates how actively a stock is traded. The yearly return is the percentage difference in price from the beginning  to the end of the year; showing the investor if the shares gained or lost value with time. 

In the output table, Steve will be able to evaluate which stocks had greater returns to help his parents make informed decisions about where to invest based on historical data.
